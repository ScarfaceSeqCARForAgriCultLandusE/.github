## Description

This dataset is a filtered subset of the full LUCAS SOIL campaigns shapefile, including only:

- Points located in **Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Piedmont and Veneto**
- Points where a **soil sample was collected during the 2018 campaign**
- Points where **textural (particle size distribution)** data are available (i.e., clay, silt, sand)

Each point represents a LUCAS survey location with spatial coordinates and associated soil properties.

## Notes

- The `Available` column corresponds to the Excel column **`PSDAvailable`**
- The `From` column indicates the **source campaign year** of the texture values
- The shapefile was derived from the Excel data in `LUCAS_Text_All_10032025.xlsx` and matched by `POINTID`
- Only 2018-sampled points with valid texture measurements were retained in this subset
- The texture classification columns were derived using the Python package [`soiltexture`](https://pypi.org/project/soiltexture/)

---

## Usage

This dataset is suitable for:

- Mapping soil texture across northern Italian regions
- Regional soil quality comparisons
- Environmental modeling and agronomic zoning
