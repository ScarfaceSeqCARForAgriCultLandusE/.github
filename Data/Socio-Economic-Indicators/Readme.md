## 📚 Source and Background

These indicators are part of the *A misura di Comune* initiative, developed under an agreement between:

- **Istat** (Italian National Institute of Statistics)
- **ANCI** (National Association of Italian Municipalities)
- **UPI** (Union of Italian Provinces)

The project promotes the development of **integrated, harmonized territorial information systems**, leveraging **Open Data** from other Sistan entities such as the Ministry of the Interior, Ministry of Economy and Finance, Ministry of Economic Development, and ISPRA.

Experimental data from the **ARCH.I.M.E.DE. project** are also included, notably from the "Socio-economic conditions of families" database.
