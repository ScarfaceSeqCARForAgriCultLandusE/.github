# SCARFACE Data Repository

This repository supports the SCARFACE project, which focuses on evaluating carbon sequestration in agricultural systems in the Po Valley (Italy) using geostatistical learning and data science techniques. The repository is organized around multiple datasets and scripts for the analysis of animal breeding, land use, and morphometric characteristics of the territory.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- `Animals/`: Contains animal population and breeding data at the municipal level. Original and processed data are provided at yearly frequency. 
- `CORINE Land Cover 2018/`: . The dataset land cover as 100 m raster data of 2018 reference year.   .
- `EEA/`  Aggiungi risoluzione spaziale e temporale.:
- `EDGAR Emissions/`: Contains spatio-temporal datasets from the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) of European Commission. Edgar provides data on annual emissions of greenhouse gasses and pollutants on a regular 0.1 x 0.1 grid worldwide.  Emission refer to either total human activities and sector specific activity agricolture and livestock.  
- `ElevationData/`: Includes elevation models and altitude-related data.
-  `Metereology`/ : Data from ECMWF, on a regular 0.1 x 0.1 grid.
- `LAU PO Valley Metadata/`: Meta data of the municipality.
- `European Drought Observatory/`: Contains morphometric indicators (e.g., slope, roughness) and geographic information from ISTAT (to be organised)
- `LUCAS/`: Restructured contents from earlier folder arrangements.
- `MorfometricData`: Visual representation of altitude data.
- `Socio-Economic-Indicators`: Spreadsheet with altitude values by municipality.
